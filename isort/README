This illustrates the speed performance we can gain from NOT
swapping adjacent elements when doing insertion sort.

Instead, we find out the final position of each element, then
shift the entire affected block by 1 position.

It gives a slightly more than 2x speed improvement over the 
conventional insertion sort.


NOTE: valgrind shows a memory leak when compiled with -pg flags.
